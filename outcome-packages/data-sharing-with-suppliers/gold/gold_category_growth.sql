-- Category growth, one row per category x fiscal period (NRF 4-5-4). Phase-0
-- decision: INTERPRETATION A (collaborative) -- growth analysed WITH and
-- attributed TO suppliers, integrating the promo-ROI, customer-LTV and
-- supplier scorecards (each a MATERIALIZED VIEW, so this view reads precomputed
-- tables, not the recomputed DAG). Upstream signals are LEFT JOINed, so the view
-- returns rows (and NULLs those columns) if an upstream view yields nothing.
--
-- Revenue base = POS `sales` x product x fiscal calendar (scanned once, reused).
--
-- Period comparison uses the fiscal period_index = fiscal_year*12 + fiscal_period,
-- so PoP = index-1 and YoY = index-12 always compare LIKE fiscal periods (never
-- raw calendar offsets):
--   pop_growth_pct = 100 * (revenue - prior_period_revenue) / prior_period_revenue
--   yoy_growth_pct = 100 * (revenue - prior_year_revenue)  / prior_year_revenue
-- (NULL when the prior period/year is absent.)
--
-- Growth decomposition of delta_revenue = revenue - prior_period_revenue, with
-- D = distribution points (distinct product x store), q = units/point (U/D),
-- P = avg price (R/U); subscripts 0=prior, 1=current. The four effects RECONCILE
-- EXACTLY to delta_revenue:
--   distribution_effect = (D1 - D0) * q0 * P0
--   volume_effect       = D1 * (q1 - q0) * P0
--   price_effect        = U1 * price_component
--   mix_effect          = U1 * mix_component
-- where, over the category's sub-categories sc (weights w = unit share, p = sub-
-- category avg price; new/dropped sub-cats contribute 0 on the missing side):
--   mix_component   = SUM( (w1_sc - w0_sc) * p0_sc )
--   price_component = SUM( w1_sc * (p1_sc - p0_sc) )
-- so (mix_component + price_component) = (P1 - P0) and the four effects sum to
-- U1*P1 - U0*P0 = delta_revenue.
--
-- category_share        = category_revenue / total revenue that period.
-- promo_contribution    = incremental margin (gold_promo_roi_by_category) for the
--                         category in the period (promo mapped to its end period).
-- value_share_*         = revenue split across CLV value tiers (gold_customer_ltv,
--                         customer-attributed orders) -- high- vs low-value growth.
-- supplier_contribution = top supplier's share of category procurement spend, with
--                         its scorecard composite (gold_supplier_scorecard).
