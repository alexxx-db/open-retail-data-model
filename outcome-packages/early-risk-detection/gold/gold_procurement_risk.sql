-- A procurement risk register: one row per supplier (current fiscal period),
-- with the contributing factors as columns so the register explains itself.
-- Built on gold_supplier_scorecard (a MATERIALIZED VIEW) plus sourcing/spend
-- from the PO-line fact.
--
-- Factors (each 0-100, higher = riskier; missing inputs default to 0):
--   performance_risk    = 100 - current composite_score (inverse of the scorecard).
--   trend_risk          = decline in composite over the trailing K fiscal periods.
--                         trend_delta = composite_current - mean(composite over the
--                         K periods BEFORE current); only declines count:
--                         trend_risk = 100 * min(max(-trend_delta / TREND_CAP, 0), 1).
--                         A falling supplier surfaces even if its current score is OK.
--   concentration_risk  = 100 * concentration_hhi, where concentration_hhi is the
--                         supplier's spend-weighted average category HHI (Herfindahl
--                         index of supplier spend share within each category it serves).
--                         HHI convention: FRACTIONAL [0,1] (1 = single supplier).
--   single_source_flag  = TRUE if the supplier is the SOLE source for >= 1 SKU;
--                         single_sourced_sku_count exposes how many.
--   geo_risk            = 100 * the largest share that the supplier's OWN country holds
--                         of any category it serves; geo_concentration_flag if that
--                         share exceeds GEO_THRESHOLD.
--
-- risk_score = weighted blend of the five factors (weights in the `w` CTE, sum to 100).
-- risk_tier  = thresholds on risk_score, with two escalators: single_source_flag OR a
--              steep trend (trend_risk >= TREND_ESCALATE) force at least HIGH, so those
--              two exposures surface regardless of the blended score.
-- top_risk_factors = the up-to-3 factors with the largest weighted contribution.
