-- Layer: outcome package (gold / consumable)
-- Materialization: Lakeflow Declarative Pipeline materialized view, refreshed on
--   the fiscal-period cadence. gold_procurement_risk and gold_category_growth
--   read the MATERIALIZED table, so the KPI aggregation runs once per refresh.

-- Per-supplier performance scorecard, one row per supplier x fiscal period
-- (NRF 4-5-4 period from the fiscal calendar). The objective input to
-- procurement-risk decisions.
--
-- KPIs (per supplier x fiscal period):
--   otif_pct  = lines delivered ON TIME (actual <= promised) AND IN FULL
--               (received >= ordered * IN_FULL_TOLERANCE, default 1.0)
--               / total order lines.
--   fill_rate = SUM(received_qty) / SUM(ordered_qty).
--   avg_lead_time_days = mean(actual_delivery_date - order_date) over delivered lines.
--   lead_time_variance = POPULATION variance (var_pop) of lead time over delivered lines.
--   defect_rate = (defective + returned units) / received units.
--   price_compliance_pct = lines with unit_price <= contract_price / total order lines.
--
-- Composite (0-100), weights surfaced in the `w` CTE (NOT buried). Each KPI is
-- normalized to a 0-100 sub-score (higher = better) BEFORE weighting:
--   otif_score   = otif_pct * 100
--   fill_score   = LEAST(fill_rate, 1) * 100
--   lead_score   = 100 * GREATEST(0, 1 - lead_time_variance / VAR_CAP)   (VAR_CAP days^2)
--   defect_score = 100 * GREATEST(0, 1 - defect_rate / DEFECT_CAP)
--   price_score  = price_compliance_pct * 100
--   composite_score = SUM(weight_i * score_i) / SUM(weight_i)   (weights sum to 100)
-- composite_score is NULL only if a component KPI is undefined (surfaced as a
-- DQ metric, not a failure).
