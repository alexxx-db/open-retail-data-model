-- Operational "did it sell?" summary per promotion: scope size, promoted
-- units/revenue, baseline units, planned trade spend, and planned vs realized
-- lift. The financial "did it pay off?" view is gold_promo_roi.
--
-- A clean roll-up of gold_trade_promotion (promo x product x store x week) to
-- one row per promotion, with a single join to the promotion dimension for
-- mechanics and dates. Grouping keys are enumerated explicitly, no
-- always-true filters, single dimension join, base table scanned once.
