-- ============================================================
-- Did the promotion pay off? One row per completed promotion: incremental
-- units / revenue / margin over baseline, ROI on trade spend, realized vs
-- planned lift, and the two value-killers (cannibalization, forward buy).
--
-- This is a clean roll-up of gold_promo_roi_by_category (a MATERIALIZED VIEW; the promo x category
-- drill) — all measures are additive across categories; ROI and realized lift
-- are recomputed from the summed components. trade_spend allocations sum back
-- to the promotion's planned_trade_spend. incremental_* and
-- net_incremental_margin are NOT clamped: negative = the promo lost money.
