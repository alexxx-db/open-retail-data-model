-- Post-Promotion ROI at promo x category grain. gold_promo_roi rolls this
-- up to one row per promo. Definitions:
--   baseline_*        : from the trailing-8 non-promoted-week mean
--                       (gold_weekly_baseline), summed over the promo window
--                       (i.e. scaled to the promo's duration).
--   incremental_units = promoted_units - baseline_units (NOT clamped; a
--                       negative value is a real "promo lost volume" signal).
--   incremental_margin= promoted_margin - baseline_margin, where
--                       margin = revenue - units * product.unit_cost.
--   trade_spend       : planned_trade_spend allocated to the category by its
--                       share of the promo's scope rows (realized actuals are
--                       not modelled — see summary).
--   roi               = incremental_margin / NULLIF(trade_spend, 0).
--   cannibalization   : shortfall below baseline on SUBSTITUTE SKUs (same
--                       category, NOT on this promo) in the promo's stores
--                       during the window.
--   forward_buy       : shortfall below baseline on the PROMOTED SKUs in the
--                       N fiscal weeks after the promo (pantry loading);
--                       N = forward_buy_weeks (default 2, see params CTE; keep
--                       in sync with seeds.yaml post_promo.forward_buy_weeks).
--   net_incremental_margin = incremental_margin - cannibalization_margin
--                            - forward_buy_margin.
