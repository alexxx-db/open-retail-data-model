-- One row per promotion x product x store x fiscal week. Joins the
-- trade-promotion dimension to its product/store scope and to weekly POS
-- sales, with planned trade spend allocated evenly across the promo's
-- scope and weeks, and a baseline of trailing non-promoted demand.
--
-- Baseline: mean weekly non-promoted units over the trailing 8 fiscal weeks
-- (current week excluded) for the same product x store; NULL when fewer than
-- 4 non-promoted weeks are available (DQ reports the NULL rate as a metric).
-- All retail-week logic flows through the NRF 4-5-4 fiscal calendar.
