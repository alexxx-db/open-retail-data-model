-- Layer: outcome package (gold / reusable building block)
-- Materialization: Lakeflow Declarative Pipeline materialized view, refreshed
--   on the fiscal-period cadence by the pipeline schedule. Downstream gold
--   views (gold_promo_roi_by_category, gold_promo_roi) read the MATERIALIZED
--   table, so the trailing-baseline scan runs once per refresh, not per query.

-- ============================================================
-- Per product x store x fiscal week: actual sales and the trailing
-- non-promoted baseline. Materialized once and reused by gold_promo_roi
-- (for promoted SKUs, substitute SKUs and post-promo weeks alike), so the
-- baseline definition lives in ONE place.
--
-- baseline_units = mean weekly NO_PROMO units over the trailing 8 fiscal
-- weeks (current week excluded); NULL when fewer than 4 non-promoted weeks
-- are available. Identical definition to gold_trade_promotion's baseline.
